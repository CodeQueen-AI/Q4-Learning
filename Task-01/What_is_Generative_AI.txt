🎯 Definition of Generative AI
Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates new and original content such as text, images, audio, video and code by learning from existing data

📌 Introduction to Generative AI
1-A type of Artificial Intelligence Focuses on generating new content rather than just analyzing or predicting
2-It can create human-like text, realistic images, music, code and more
3-Models are trained using huge datasets to learn patterns
4-Then they use those patterns to generate new and creative outputs

🧠 How Generative AI Works
Step 1: Data Collection
AI is trained on large datasets (e.g., books, images, audio files)
Step 2: Model Training
Neural networks (especially deep learning models like transformers) learn patterns from the data
Step 3: Content Generation
Once trained, the model can generate new, original outputs

🧰 Tools & Frameworks Used in Generative AI
1-TensorFlow – For building machine learning models
2-PyTorch – Most popular for deep learning
3-Hugging Face – Pre-trained AI models (like GPT, BERT)
4-OpenAI API – Access models like ChatGPT, DALL·E, Whisper
5-Keras – Simplified neural network building
6-Google Colab – Free environment for coding AI models
7-Stable Diffusion – Image generation model

💻 Programming Languages
Python – Main language used in AI/ML and generative models 
JavaScript / TypeScript – For building web apps with AI
SQL – For data extraction and handling
R – Statistical analysis
Shell/Bash – For automation and running models
