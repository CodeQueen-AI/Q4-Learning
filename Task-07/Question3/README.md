# 🧠 Why is the User Prompt Passed in Runner.run()?  
## 💡 And Why is run() a Classmethod?

## 🧠 Why Pass the User Prompt in `Runner.run()`?

The user prompt is the **input message/question** that the user wants the AI agent to respond to.

### 🔹 Purpose:
Passing the prompt dynamically allows you to:
- Ask **different questions** without changing the agent
- Use the **same logic** across many types of conversations
- Keep your agent flexible and reusable

## 💡 Why is `run()` a Classmethod?

Using `@classmethod` means we can call the method directly on the class, like:

```python
Runner.run(agent, "Hello world")
````

Instead of:

```python
runner = Runner()
runner.run(agent, "Hello world")
```

### ✅ Benefits:

* No need to create a `Runner` object
* **Cleaner syntax** and structure
* Perfect for utility-style coordination (where no internal state is needed)
* Keeps the architecture **stateless** and **scalable**

| Concept         | Benefit                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Prompt** | Dynamic, flexible input for each run                 |
| **Classmethod** | No instantiation required, clean and reusable design |

This structure is commonly used in **LLM pipelines**, **tool-using agents**, and **multi-agent systems**.
